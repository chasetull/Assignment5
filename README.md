Assignment 5

The program begins presenting the user with a menu. There are 14 options to pick from. You can add a student or faculty member and exit easily. The other options do not work as intended for I believe serialization got the best of me.

I couldn't figure out how to utilize serialization in order to save the data for each student and faculty member tree. I was able to have the user create a new student or faculty and add them to their respective tree, but due to no serialization I couldn't retrieve any existing data for the user as in printing current students/faculty. If I was allowed to store the data in another format I believe this program would be more complete. I also was not able to figure out how to save states of the program, and couldn't implement the RollBack function. I believe this assignment does not reflect my ability, and I wish I gave myself more time to do it correcly.

I used my friends Lip Augustowski and Nate Everette as help.
